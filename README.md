# POP-Flow-Controller
A POP driven approach to VC Flow control for things like an apps first run experience.

A collection of protocols that facilitate turning objects with a few conformances into a nice compartmentalized flow controller so all your pieces donâ€™t have to know about each other to work well together.

This still needs documentation, but there is a sample project with working example to see how to use this.
